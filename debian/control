Description: Peer finder daemon for StatefulSet
 This is a simple peer finder daemon that is useful with StatefulSet and
 related use cases. All it does is watch DNS for changes in the set of
 endpoints that are part of the governing service of the PetSet. It
 periodically looks up the SRV record of the DNS entry that corresponds
 to a Kubernetes Service which enumerates the set of peers for this the
 specified service.
